  <p>4. Each hosting locations are very effective for storing articles. Each hosting server has their own 
   level of security for example the csis server. The csis is constantly monitored by SVSU and you need special 
   permission to access it. Another hosting location such as 000webhost is very easy to use and can give you 
   more options as you pay for subscriptions. To pick i woudl go with 000webhost. Althouhg it has subscriptions
   which i can not afford currently. it is easy to use and allows you to utilize it full potention for creating 
   and storing information.
